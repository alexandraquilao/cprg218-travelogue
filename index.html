                <h2> Vancouver </h2>
                <p> Vancouver, BC, Canada—though not too far from Calgary, Alberta—is one of my favorite places to visit and the destination I travel to most often. 
                    Whether it's for a concert, catching up with friends and family, or simply for fun, I find myself flying there at least once a year. 
                    I love the city's mild climate and inviting atmosphere; despite my visits being brief, Vancouver always feels like home.

                    There’s never a dull moment, whether it's hiking scenic trails, taking long walks along the beach, or exploring the city with friends. 
                    But if I had to choose, visiting the beach would be my favorite part of every trip.
                     There’s something magical about basking in the warmth of the sun, lost in a book or simply embracing the moment, 
                     surrounded by the sounds of laughter and the peaceful rhythm of the waves.</p>
                     <h3> Travel Tips!</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Take the Skytrain:</strong>  
                            Save money from Uber and taxi fares. 
                            The subway system (Skytrain) is a very useful way to get around the city, 
                            especially if your main destinations are just within downtown/the city in general. </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Wear comfortable shoes:</strong>
                                 I personally always do a lot of walking to get to my destinations within downtown Vancouver. 
                                Having comfortable shoes will save your feet at the end of the day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bring a Camera:</strong>  This is more of a recommendation than a tip and applies to all travel destinations, not just Vancouver. 
                                Capturing memories through the use of a camera is something I have come to enjoy in recent years. 
                                Time flies by as I grow older so I need to be able to capture meaningful memories.
