                <h2> Vancouver </h2>
                <p> Vancouver, BC, Canada—though not too far from Calgary, Alberta—is one of my favorite places to visit and the destination I travel to most often. 
                    Whether it's for a concert, catching up with friends and family, or simply for fun, I find myself flying there at least once a year. 
                    I love the city's mild climate and inviting atmosphere; despite my visits being brief, Vancouver always feels like home.

                    There's never a dull moment, whether it's hiking scenic trails, taking long walks along the beach, or exploring the city with friends. 
                    But if I had to choose, visiting the beach would be my favorite part of every trip.
                     There's something magical about basking in the warmth of the sun, lost in a book or simply embracing the moment, 
                     surrounded by the sounds of laughter and the peaceful rhythm of the waves.</p>
                     <h3> Travel Tips!</h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li><strong>Take the Skytrain:</strong>  
                            Save money from Uber and taxi fares. 
                            The subway system (Skytrain) is a very useful way to get around the city, 
                            especially if your main destinations are just within downtown/the city in general. </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Wear comfortable shoes:</strong>
                                 I personally always do a lot of walking to get to my destinations within downtown Vancouver. 
                                Having comfortable shoes will save your feet at the end of the day.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Bring a Camera:</strong>  This is more of a recommendation than a tip and applies to all travel destinations, not just Vancouver. 
                                Capturing memories through the use of a camera is something I have come to enjoy in recent years. 
                                Time flies by as I grow older so I need to be able to capture meaningful memories. 
                            </li>

            <section id="South Korea">
                <h2> South Korea </h2>
                <p> South Korea was my top travel destination of 2024, as it marked my first-ever visit to the country. 
                    The experience was both new and refreshing, filled with endless things to see and do. 
                    Unfortunately, my time there was limited to just five days, but I made the most of every moment, squeezing in as much as I could.

                    One of the highlights of my trip was undoubtedly the food. 
                    I explored a variety of restaurants and cuisines, but if there's one dish you absolutely must try, it's Korean barbecue (KBBQ).
                     While we do have KBBQ in Calgary, the experience in South Korea is on an entirely different level.
                    
                    As for sightseeing, some of my favorite spots in Seoul included Gyeongbokgung Palace, The Hyundai Mall, and the Han River. 
                    Visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace is a must, especially since you can enter for free if you wear a traditional hanbok. 
                    It's a fantastic experience and perfect for capturing beautiful photos—just be mindful of the weather, as wearing a hanbok in the heat can be quite challenging!
                    
                    The Hyundai Mall was another highlight, a massive and visually stunning shopping destination filled with luxury brands as well as trendy, up-and-coming labels. 
                    I loved exploring the different styles and fashion trends unique to South Korea. 
                    Just a short walk through Yeouido Park, located beside the mall, leads to a serene park along the Han River. 
                    It was the perfect place for a stroll, a picnic, or simply relaxing with friends and family.
                    
                    Despite packing so much into my trip, there were still countless places I didn't get to visit.
                     South Korea left such an impression on me that I'm already looking forward to returning in the future! </p>

                     </h3>
                     <ul>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Make use of the transit system! </strong>  Similarly to Vancouver, the subway system was very convenient in the centre of Seoul. 
                            Traffic in the city can be really intense during peak hours, so using the subway can save a lot of time and money.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Wowpass
                            </strong>  is a prepaid card in South Korea designed for seamless, cashless payments and can also be used for transportation. 
                            For added convenience, you can download the Wowpass app, which allows for quick and easy transfers from your bank to the card.
                             If you don't have access to the app, you can still reload your card using self-service machines available in convenience stores. 
                             These machines are user-friendly and even accept cash, making it simple to top up your balance anytime.

            <section id="Philippines">
                <h2> Philippines </h2>
                <p> The Philippines is my home country and the place where I have spent the longest time while traveling. 
                    During my month-long stay, I cherished moments in my childhood home with relatives while also taking the opportunity to explore different parts of the country.

                    In Manila, the bustling capital, I spent time at our family's condominium, where I indulged in a variety of restaurants and visited the famous Mall of Asia. 
                    It had been my first time there since childhood, making it a nostalgic experience as I revisited old memories.
                    
                    Another highlight of my trip was Tagaytay, where I attended my cousin's wedding. 
                    This picturesque city, perched on a ridge, offers breathtaking views and a cool, refreshing climate—a welcome escape from the usual Philippine heat.
                     Though small and quaint, Tagaytay has a charm of its own, making it a peaceful retreat.
                    
                    For most of my stay, I was in Batangas City, spending time at my grandmother's house.
                     Those days were filled with relaxation, family bonding, and enjoying my grandma's homemade meals—something I had missed for so long. 
                     While I can't recommend many tourist spots there since I haven't explored much outside of family visits, 
                     I can confidently say Batangas is the best place to enjoy Lomi, a delicious Filipino noodle dish.
                    
                    The Philippines is a country rich in warmth—both in its people and its food. No matter where I go, it will always be home.</p>
                    <h3> Travel Tips!</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           <strong>Carry cash </strong> - I would recommend having cash as your way of payment as a good amount of vendors do not take card payments, especially for street food! 
                        </li>
                        <li>    
                            <strong>Carry a portable fan! </strong> The Philippine heat is no joke, and it is usually hot all year round except for stormy seasons. Having a portable electric/traditional fan helps a lot! 
                        </li>
